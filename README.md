# QMRD3
Qualification Model Rover Demonstrator for Deep Drilling

Note: This rover uses the following bearing in 28+ locations: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3116838
      The bearing is a remix and therefore is released under a separate license and is maintained on Thingiverse. 
      Thanks to Zh4x0r for creating the parametric model with an integral lip, and thanks to Emmett for inventing 
      the gear bearing and completely changing the game.
      
This project is intended to be a testbed for future work on developing Mars ice drilling technologies. It would not be possible 
without the pioneering work by Github user Roger-random, who created the amazing Sawppy rover on which this rover is based. 
The Sawppy is a truly amazing and elegant design at an affordable price.

Unfortunately, this rover is not cheap. The wheels are around $100 each to print. 

Stay tuned as the rest of the parts get updated and added to this repository. When the CAD model is cleaned up enough I'll post
a Fusion 360 Archive so others can follow my work.
